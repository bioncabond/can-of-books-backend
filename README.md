**Authors**: Bionca Bond & Jae Loney


## What can books do?

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Build out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.


**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
This app was built to create a list of the users favourite books. The user enters books they enjoy on the client fron-end which is then passed to the server and down to a database. The purpose of this app is to pass Codefellows' Code 301 Course.

## Architecture
Javascript, React, MongoDB, Netlify, Heroku, Github, Insomnia
